

Split the numbers from 1 to n in sqrt(n) ranges so that range i corresponds to [sqrt(n) * i .. sqrt(n) * (i + 1)).

Do one pass through the stream of numbers and figure out how many numbers fall in each of the ranges.

At least one of the ranges will contain more than sqrt(n) elements.

Do another pass and process just those elements in the oversubscribed range.

Using a hash table to keep frequencies, youâ€™ll find a repeated element.

This is O(sqrt(n)) memory and 2 sequential passes through the stream.
