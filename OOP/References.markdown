1. [What is an abstract class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1320745/abstract-class-in-java) 
2. [Implements vs extends](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-implements-and-extends) Also note that an interface can extend multiple interfaces.  But a class can extend only one class.  A class can also implement multiple interfaces!. 
3. [Polymorphism](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_polymorphism.htm)
4. [Lambdas](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/lambda-expressions.html)
    + [Why to use them](https://dzone.com/articles/why-we-need-lambda-expressions)

5. [Access Modifiers](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html)
6. [Abstract Classes vs Interfaces](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html) I made an example method about this as well. 
"Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods."
